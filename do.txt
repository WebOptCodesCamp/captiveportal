without modifying preexistiing ui/ux design of the project , i want you to first read the project and understand
it. after that then i want you to  remove login or register process on this project ( instead make usemac address of device that is captured in root folder which is at index.php to manage bundle purchasing and also incase when buying bundle and phone number is required you can ask the user to enter his number through a pop up box after clicking bundle product) , instead of login page redirect
the user to bundles.php to purchase bundle.in admin side keep everything as they are but there in adding bundle or modifying bundle item admin can also add unlimited bundle access by checking unlimit bundle usage box which in turn will disable bundle limit slider .don't modify project functionality.plan first and ask me for review before proceeding.project schema is available at database.php modify it where necessary.
